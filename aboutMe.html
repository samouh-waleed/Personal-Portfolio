        <div class="main-content aboutMePar">
          <p>My name is Waleed Samouh, a 20-year-old computer science student at York University, with a passion for technology and innovation. I come from a diverse background, 
            enjoying various hobbies like traveling, playing soccer, and beach volleyball. My unique strength lies in my adaptability and eagerness to learn, which have 
            helped me excel in various aspects of life.</p>
            <!-- <br> -->

          <p>My high school computer science teacher, is my all-time favorite educator. His enthusiasm for technology was contagious, and he constantly pushed us to 
            think outside the box. His consistent support and belief in my abilities inspired me to pursue a career in computer science.</p>

         <p>my life story is one of exploration, growth, and inspiration, rooted in a diverse upbringing and driven by a passion for technology. Studying computer science at 
          York University, I am eager to continue my journey, build on my strengths, and make a lasting impact in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
